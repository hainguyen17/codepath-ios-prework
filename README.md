## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Example App #1: Notes (IOS)
    - Easy formatting
    - Cloud Sync.
    
- Example App #2: Google Calendar 
    - Allow  multiple viewing options
    - Clear action buttons: Add/Modify events
    
- Example App #3: Google Maps 
    - Swipe up to explore the selected area
    - Allow  pins and labellings (favorite locations, travel plan, etc.)
    - Accessibility features (such as speak aloud, zoom, different map layouts)

APP IDEAS
- I would like to redesign the shopping experience on Amazon's mobile app (specifically focusing on improving the checkout process). While Amazon is a popular retail platform used by people every day, the current checkout process is somewhat lengthy, and the information hierarchy is densely packed into a single screen. Additionally, there are often multiple action buttons on a single screen, which can be confusing for users who are new to the app. I want to try to reconsider the app flow and the components of the existing UI to create a more seamless, worry-free and goal-targeted user experience.
 
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- It took sometimes for me to familiarize and navigate through the Xcode interface.
- My Macbook is pretty slow, and so does the time to run the app simulation.
